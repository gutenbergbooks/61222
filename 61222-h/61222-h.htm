<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>It was my intention that this Series should have comprised D’Oyley’s and Anti-Macassars,
but at the request of many ladies who have honored me with their patronage,
I have been induced to present Collars, &amp;c. in this the Fourth Series, and defer
the publication of the other articles to the Fifth, which will appear shortly. Sincerely
acknowledging the approbation and support received from my numerous correspondents,
I shall be most happy in return to afford all the information in my power,
and elucidate difficulties, should any arise in the following directions.</p>
