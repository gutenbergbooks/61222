PREFACE.


It was my intention that this Series should have comprised D’Oyley’s and
Anti-Macassars, but at the request of many ladies who have honored me
with their patronage, I have been induced to present Collars, &c. in this
the Fourth Series, and defer the publication of the other articles to the
Fifth, which will appear shortly. Sincerely acknowledging the approbation
and support received from my numerous correspondents, I shall be most
happy in return to afford all the information in my power, and elucidate
difficulties, should any arise in the following directions.

                                      ELEÒNORE RIEGO DE LA BRANCHARDIERE.
